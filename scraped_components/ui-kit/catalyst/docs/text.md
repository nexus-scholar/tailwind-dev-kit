## Examples

### Basic example

Use the `Text` component for any custom paragraph text that should match the style of the text built in to your other
components:

Deleting your account is permanent, and your data will not be able to be recovered.

```tsx
import { Text } from '@/components/text'

function Example() {
  return <Text>Deleting your account is permanent, and your data will not be able to be recovered.</Text>
}
```

Paragraphs using `Text` are responsive and automatically adapt to dark mode.

### With link

Use the `TextLink` component for any links within a `Text` component:

Deleting your account is permanent, and your data will not be able to be recovered. If you still want to use this account in the future, learn about pausing your subscription instead.

```tsx
import { Text, TextLink } from '@/components/text'

function Example() {
  return (
    <Text>
      Deleting your account is permanent, and your data will not be able to be recovered. If you still want to use this
      account in the future, learn about <TextLink href="#">pausing your subscription</TextLink> instead.
    </Text>
  )
}
```

### With strong

Use the `Strong` component for any text you want to emphasize within a `Text` component:

Deleting your account is permanent, and your account data cannot be recovered.

```tsx
import { Strong, Text } from '@/components/text'

function Example() {
  return (
    <Text>
      Deleting your account is permanent, and <Strong>your account data cannot be recovered</Strong>.
    </Text>
  )
}
```

### With code

Use the `Code` component for any inline code symbols within a `Text` component:

Your new API token is `BaVrRKpRMS_ndKU`. Store this token somewhere safe as it will only be displayed once.

```tsx
import { Code, Text } from '@/components/text'

function Example() {
  return (
    <Text>
      Your new API token is <Code>BaVrRKpRMS_ndKU</Code>. Store this token somewhere safe as it will only be displayed
      once.
    </Text>
  )
}
```
